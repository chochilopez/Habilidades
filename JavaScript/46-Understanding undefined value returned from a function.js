/*
Explanation:
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

Exercise:
Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.

Tests:
Waiting:addFive should be a function.
Waiting:Once both functions have run, the sum should be equal to 8.
Waiting:Returned value from addFive should be undefined.
Waiting:Inside the addFive function, you should add 5 to the sum variable.

// Setup
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line


// Only change code above this line

addThree();
addFive();
*/
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

function addFive() {
	sum = sum + 5;
}

addThree();
addFive();

console.log();
